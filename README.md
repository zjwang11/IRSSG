# IRSSG
*An Open-Source Software Package for Spin Space Sroups*

Ref: Zhang, Sheng et al, arXiv:2511.21921 (2025). https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21821
  
We develop the package **IRSSG** to obtain the irreducible (co)representations of spin space groups (SSGs) for magnetic materials **in the absence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC)**, and to analyze the band topology and symmetry of energy bands.  

IRSSG

- finds all SSG operators and the SSG international notation for any given magnetic crystal structure,
- generates the character tables of SSG little groups for high-symmetry **k**-points,
- computes the traces of matrix representations of SSG operators and assigns the corresponding (co-)irrep labels to magnetic energy bands.

## 1. SSG detection from POSCAR

By providing a modified `POSCAR`, where magnetic moments follow the internal atomic positions, IRSSG returns:

- the **SSG type**,  
- the **spin-only group** \(S_0\),  
- the **subgroup** \(G_0\),  
- and the **SSG international notation**,

by executing:

```bash
irssg -ssg [-c filename] [--tolerance dl] [--magtolerance dm] > ssg.out
```

where:

- `filename` is the name of the `POSCAR` file,  
- `dl` is the real-space symmetry tolerance (in units of length),  
- `dm` is the magnetic-moment matching tolerance used in the magnetic symmetry search (in units of μB).

At the same time, a file **`ssg.data`** is written, which is later used to compute band characters and (co)irreps under plane-wave or Wannier bases.

## 2. Plane-wave (VASP) interface

To obtain the band characters and (co)irreps for bands generated by **VASP**, the user should provide three input files before running IRSSG:

- `OUTCAR`  
- `WAVECAR`  
- `ssg.data`

The former two are generated by VASP; `ssg.data` comes from the previous `-ssg` step.

With `ssg.data` prepared and a finished VASP calculation (producing `WAVECAR` and `OUTCAR`), IRSSG returns:

- the character tables of the SSG coirreps on the **k-point interval** \([a, b]\),  
- together with the band characters and (co)irreps for the **band index range** \([m, n]\),

by executing:

```bash
irssg -pw [-nk a b] [-nb m n] [-tolE dE] > irssg.out
```

where:

- `dE` is the upper bound on the energy difference of the bands associated with a given irreducible representation.

---

## 3. Wannier (tight-binding) interface

To obtain band characters and (co)irreps under a **Wannier basis**, the user should provide three input files:

- `wannier90_hr.dat`  
- `tbbox.in`  
- `ssg.data`

IRSSG then returns the character tables of the SSG coirreps, together with the band characters and (co)irreps, by executing:

```bash
irssg -wann [-nk a b] [-nb m n] [-tolE dE] > irssg.out
```

The meanings of `a`, `b`, `m`, `n`, and `dE` are the same as in the `-pw` mode.

## POS2SSG

Similar to **POS2MSG**, which automatically generates all possible magnetic space groups (MSGs) with the highest symmetry, a minor tool **POS2SSG** is developed to generate all highest-symmetry magnetic configurations by assigning magnetic moments to all magnetic atoms, each configuration corresponding to a specific **SSG number**.
